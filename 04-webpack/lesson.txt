bundler: tool you can send js, css, html, images. stylus, Saas, etc.
bundler can run a local server, manage dependencies, 
improve compatibility(transfer js, deploy website etc.)
Why webpack?
- most popular
- handle a lot of our needs (local server, module etc.)
- good documentation, community, well mantained
- a little hard to configure tho

run: npm run dev
build: npm run build 

working files are inside the src folder (html, css, js)
the root of all work in webpack is the js file(script.js)
the script file inside index.html is not required. it is added automatically
style of script.js is in the style.css file
